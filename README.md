**Summary**:
My project looked at how students motivation levels affect their exam scores. I used the programming language “R” to import and clean this dataset, and making sure the data was easy to work with and what attributes to use and compare. After processing, I ran a statistical analysis to see if the level of motivation in a student made a difference in how well they did on their exams. The interesting part was that surprisingly enough it had almost no effect to the exam scores. One of the main visualizations i used was a boxplot, which showed the range of exam scores for students with High, Low, and Medium motivation levels. The boxplot revealed that the exam scores were pretty similar across all motivation levels, but students with High and Medium motivation had more outliers, meaning some of them scored much higher than the rest. I wrote the code using R, using functions like ‘boxplot()’ to create this visualization and others. Along the way, i fixed some errors in the code to make sure the graphs properly reflected the data. One of the problems i ran into was selecting what type of graph or visualization to use, i tried using a scatter plot but it did not represent the change or fluctuation well in the data. 

**Conclusion:**
In the end, the analysis showed that motivation does have an effect on exam performance, but it’s not the only thing that matters. Students with high motivation were more likely to have standout scores, but overall, exam scores were similar for all motivation levels. This suggests that other factors might also play a big role in how well students perform. Overall, the project helped show how useful data analysis and visualization can be in understanding patterns and trends in student overall performance.

**Future Ideas:**
In the future i would defiantly like to compare the same data set but with different comparisons like maybe using an attribute like parental involvement against sleep hours would defiantly be a interesting result.
